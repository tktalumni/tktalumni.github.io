The Valentine's Day excitement continues as dear friends TKO-äly and TKT-alumni gather at the good old cluster<3. Expect relaxed hanging out, snacking and surely exciting moments! Who will win at pong? Can the youngsters play? Do the old folks have the stamina? This needs to be found out, and that's why during the evening, we will organize
