### TKO-äly + TKT-alumni presentation evening 16.11.2023

Do you have something to share about a hobby project, your secret passion or your career? Would you like to hear what ten years of salaried work does to a human? TKO-äly and TKT-alumni are hosting yet another collaborative presentation night, where you'll be treated to first-hand wisdom about the world of IT and computer science, from a student and alumnus point of view alike! You are also welcome to host a presentation of your own to a curious audience.
